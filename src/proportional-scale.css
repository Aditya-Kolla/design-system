/**
 * Foundation proportional font-sizing system
 *
 * The font-size of the html selector is scaled according to the viewport width.
 * This provides a general rule for readable text and optimal line length.
 * Components can then build of top of this general rule by using rem units.
 * Thus, the majority of CSS will use rem units and target class selectors.
 * Hence, the selector-max-type and declaration-property-unit-whitelist stylelint rules
 * are only disabled for the following code, rather than turned off globally.
